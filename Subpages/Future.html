        VR is increasingly being utilized in psychological treatments, including exposure therapy for PTSD and phobias. Research, such as that conducted by the University of Oxford, demonstrates that VR technology can effectively reduce anxiety in patients with conditions like agoraphobia. These VR tools simulate real-life scenarios and are effective for treatment but depend on manual operation by therapists. They also lack the ability to adjust dynamically to a patient’s emotional responses in real time. AI integration in VR for psychological therapy is still in its infancy, limiting the personalization and adaptability of the experience.

  <span class="text-highlight"><h3>Current Status:</h3></span>
  Currently, AI applications in counseling are often limited to specific languages or cultural contexts, such as chatbots or emotion analysis tools for preliminary mental health screening. These systems struggle with accurately interpreting multilingual emotional expressions or addressing cultural nuances, often leading to misunderstandings. As a result, psychological services remain inaccessible to many in multicultural or underserved areas.

  <span class="text-highlight"><h3>Future Development:</h3></span>
  Future AI systems will feature advanced multilingual capabilities and cultural adaptability. Through natural language processing, AI will accurately interpret subtle emotional cues across diverse languages while incorporating cross-cultural psychological insights to understand non-verbal expressions. These enhancements will make psychological services more accessible and inclusive, reaching a broader audience worldwide.`
